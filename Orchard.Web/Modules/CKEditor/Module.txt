Summary: CKEditor HTML WYSIWYG editor
Description: Provides CKEditor 3.6 for HTML editing. Important upgrade note: this will overwrite ckeditor.js and config.js - so if you've made any changes there, you'll have to make them again upgrading. We introduced a new configuration mechanic in 1.0.3 - please see our Project Site on Codeplex for instructions; and in 1.0.7 we have introduced a CKEditor settings page in Dashboard. 1.0.9 adds an extensible configuration system with ICKEditorConfigProvider.
