Feature: Pages
    In order to add content pages to my site
    As an author
    I want to create, publish and edit pages

Scenario: In the admin (menu) there is a link to create a Page
    Given I have installed Orchard
    When I go to "admin"
    Then I should see "<a href="/Admin/Contents/Create/Page"[^>]*>Page</a>"

Scenario: I can create and publish a new Page
    Given I have installed Orchard

            | name | value |
            | Routable.Title | Super Duper |
            | Body.Text | This is super. |
        And I hit "Publish Now"
        And I go to "super-duper"
    Then I should see "<h1[^>]*>.*?Super Duper.*?</h1>"
        And I should see "This is super."

Scenario: A new page marked to be the home page and publish does take over the home page and is not accessible from its own standard path

        And I fill in
            | name | value |

            | Body.Text | This is a draft of the new home page. |
            | Routable.PromoteToHomePage | true |
        And I hit "Publish Now"
        And I go to "/"
    Then I should see "<h1>Super Duper</h1>"
    When I go to "super-duper"
    Then the status should be 404 "Not Found"

Scenario: A new page marked to be the home page but only saved as draft does not take over the home page
